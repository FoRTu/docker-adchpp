# üêã Docker + *'ADCH++*'

Docker image of [ADCH++](https://adchpp.sourceforge.io/), a hub software for the ADC network. It implements the [ADC protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Direct_Connect).

This image use a fork of the [original code ](https://sourceforge.net/projects/adchpp/files/Releases/). This forked code is [hosted here, on github.com](https://github.com/adricu/adchpp), but I don't know if the mantainers are the same of the original code. Anyway, this is the only code I have be able compile, becouse I have try with the original using diferent metods but I don't get any useful binary.
