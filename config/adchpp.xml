		To create secure connections, set TLS="1" and define the following (preferably absolute)
		paths: Certificate, PrivateKey, TrustedPath, DHParams. An example secure server setting:
		<Server Port="2780" TLS="1" Certificate="certs/cacert.pem" PrivateKey="certs/privkey.pem" TrustedPath="certs/trusted/" DHParams="certs/dhparam.pem"/>

		Simple OpenSSL commands to generate files used for secure connections:
		openssl genrsa -out privkey.pem 2048
		openssl req -new -x509 -key privkey.pem -out cacert.pem -days 1095
		openssl dhparam -outform PEM -out dhparam.pem 1024

		Alternatively, you can use the cert generator contributed on
		<http://launchpadlibrarian.net/31960965/Cert_Generator.7z>.

	<!-- Instead of scripts, ADCH++ uses plugins. Plugins can do the same work

		 the difference between the two is absurd. This way, it's also possible to
		 write a script plugin, enabling people to choose their own script language,
		 if someone's written a script plugin for it. You must specify the path to your
		 plugins in linux default place it looks for the plugin path is /home/<username>/adchpp/ -->
